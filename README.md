This repository contains code for our paper, [_A Closer Look at System Prompt Robustness_](./paper.pdf), which studies the robustness of system prompt adherence/precedence in language models.

This repo includes:

* **evals**: Evaluation scripts for benchmarking models on RealGuardrails, Monkey Island stress test, S-RuLES, TensorTrust, S-IFEval, and MMLU
* **data_pipeline**: Scripts for generating synthetic training data

- `evals/`: Evaluation scripts and benchmarks
  - RealGuardrails benchmark and Monkey Island stress test
  - S-RuLES, TensorTrust, S-IFEval, and MMLU evaluations
  - See [evals/EVALS.md](evals/EVALS.md) for usage

- `data_pipeline/`: Synthetic data generation pipeline
  - User/assistant message generation
  - Tool use capabilities: search, browsing, etc.
  - See [data_pipeline/DATA_PIPELINE.md](data_pipeline/DATA_PIPELINE.md) for details

## Data

Our data is available on HuggingFace: [normster/RealGuardrails](https://huggingface.co/datasets/normster/RealGuardrails).

## Models

Fine-tuning was performed using the [torchllms](https://github.com/normster/torchllms) library. Trained model checkpoints are available on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/collections/normster/realguardrails-models-67ad484a279716130f624a49).
